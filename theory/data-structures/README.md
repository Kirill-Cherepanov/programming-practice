# data-structures

At first I was motivated to do this project to get a better grasp on data structures, but soon realized that it would be too inefficient. Writing a ton of methods and tests for them takes a bit too much time even for simple structures. So I'm giving up, especially considering that there already is a project that basically does the same thing I set out to do [data-structure-typed](https://github.com/zrwusa/data-structure-typed/tree/main).
